## Important before going live

Menu prices were not supplied, so the site intentionally displays "Price TBC". Add the real prices in `src/main.jsx` by changing each menu item's `price` and the display logic.

The checkout is demo-only. Before accepting real payments, connect a secure backend and Paystack or Flutterwave using server-side credentials. Do not place secret API keys in frontend code.

The supplied Google-hosted images are used as image URLs. For a production client site, consider downloading/licensing approved assets and serving optimized local/CDN copies.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is generated in `dist/`.
Cloudflare deployment test.
